    <p>My brother taught me this recipe, and I love it so I decided to share this wonderful recipe with you.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>⅔ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated orange zest</li>
        <li>¼ cup ice water</li>
        <li>¾ cup prepared mincemeat pie filling</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>¼ cup confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Sift together the flour, 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar, and cinnamon. Use a pastry cutter or two forks to mix in the butter until mixture resembles fine bread crumbs. Stir in the orange zest. Sprinkle with ice water, and gather dough into a ball. Roll out on a lightly floured surface to 1/4 inch thick. Cut out approximately 18 (3 inch) diameter circles, and 18 (2 inch) circles, rerolling dough as needed.</li>
        <li>Line muffin cups or tart tins using the 3 inch pastry circles. Fill each pastry cup with about 1 tablespoon of mincemeat filling. Top with 2 inch pastry circles, pinching circles together to seal the edges. Brush the top of each pie with egg.</li>
        <li>Bake pies in preheated oven until tops are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool slightly on wire racks. Dust with 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar just before serving.</li>
    </ol>
